// Java code to create singleton class Using Lazy Initialization.
/*
Pros:
    Object is created only if it is needed. It may overcome resource overcome and wastage of CPU time.
    Exception handling is also possible in method.
Cons:
    Every time a condition of null has to be checked.
    instance canâ€™t be accessed directly.
    In multithreaded environment, it may break singleton property.
